# Python-Botnet (UDP Flood)

A Python botnet script with a remote control system to clients with an included backdoor, a powerful script and easy to modify.
**Use at your own risk, I do not accept responsibility, only use on your own devices**




# For windows;
- Port forward / test locally
- find your IP address
- put your Server's IP address into this cool box (it should be the one you just looked up)

- run the client and it should appear when you type "list"

#for other systems
- port forward / test locally
- find your IP
- replace this variable with your IP

### 28/03/2024
* **what the fuck did I code, I just looked over that and some of it didn't even work**
* Combined start.py and Client2.0.py client2.0 now automatically adds itself to startup and will duplicate itself into your documents folder, this allows it to automatically start itself whenever the target's computer restarts, it also opens hidden in the background so they'd only notice it if they were looking for it.
* fixed the horrific spelling mistakes I now see after coming back to this page
* scrapped the shitty start.py file, now it's running a single file


### 28/04/2023
